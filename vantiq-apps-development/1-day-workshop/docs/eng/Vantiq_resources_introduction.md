# Understanding Vantiq Resources through real-world example

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%> Notification system to security guards using AI cameras  

Detect suspicious persons in a large park using AI cameras, and notify the nearest security guard.  

‚û°Ô∏è Compare **location information of AI camera** that detected suspicious person and **location information of all security guards**, and then notify the security guard who is nearest to the suspicious person.

# Prerequisites

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>Specification of the AI camera

- Model has been trained to identify the characteristics of suspicious persons.  
- When a suspicious person is captured in the camera view, send the following data via _HTTPS REST_.

```sh
{
‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",    # ID of the AI camera
‚Äúevent_type‚Äù: "notice_001",
‚Äúimage‚Äù: "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAMC...."    # Base64-encoded image
}
```

***‚Äª Generally, AI cameras do not have location information with them.
If they do, AI camera needs to be reconfigured when it gets reinstalled. ***


## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>Method of obtaining location information of security guard  

- A security guard has a smartphone with an App that acquires location.    
- App sends the following data to MQTT broker at a certain frequency, such as every 30 seconds.  

```sh
{
"guard_id": "134678493_1",    # ID of each security guard
"type": "location",
"lat": 35.6864604,             # Latitude
"lon": 139.7635769,            # Longitude
"time": 1631083251
}
```

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>Process to be implemented in Vantiq

1. Receive data from AI cameras and the location App.  
   * It should be designed to accomodate future changes (such as data format) flexibly.    

1. Enrich the data sent from AI cameras.  
   * Since AI camera does not have location itself, such data should be maintained in Vantiq side and added when necessary.    

1. Store and update the latest location information of security guards.    
   * In order to reduce the time lag for notification, the location information of the security guards is stored in advance on the Vantiq side instead of being acquired when a suspicious person is detected.    

1. Comparing the location of the AI camera which notifications were made and the location of security guards.  
   * Specify the nearest security guard.    

1. Notify the nearest security guard.    
   * Send notifications via E-mail, SMS, LINE, Slack, and in any other way you choose.    


# Implementation method

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>1. Inputting data into Vantiq  

<img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide8.png" width=70%>


‚ë†„ÄÄVantiq can process data even if the schema of the data to be received is not defined.    
‚ë°„ÄÄSource receives data via various protocols.    
‚ë¢„ÄÄTopic is an endpoint of REST API.    

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>2. Adding information to data which comes from AI cameras

<img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide9.png" width=70%>

‚ë†
```sh
{
üëâ‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",
‚Äúevent_type‚Äù: "notice_001",
‚Äúimage‚Äù: "data:image/jpe...."
}
```  
‚ë° Data formatting as needed, such as changing or deleting parameters. (Transformation)  
‚ë¢ App retrieves information of Type and adds it to the stream data that comes from AI cameras. (Enrich)    
```sh
{
üëâ‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",
üëâ‚Äúlan‚Äù: 35.6864604,
üëâ‚Äúlon‚Äù: 139.7635769,
‚Äúevent_type‚Äù: "notice001",
‚Äúimage‚Äù: "data:image/jpe...."
}
```  
‚ë£ Store information that want to add, such as the location information of AI cameras.  
``` sh
{
üëâ‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",
‚Äúlan‚Äù: 35.6864604,
‚Äúlon‚Äù: 139.7635769
}
```

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>3. Store and update the latest location information of security guards  

<img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide10.png" width=70%>  

‚ë†
```sh
{
"guard_id": "134678493_1",
"type": "location",
"lat": 35.6864604,
"lon": 139.7635769,
"time": 1631083251
}
```  
‚ë° Add information using `Enrich` if E-mail address, phone number, etc. are required for notification.    
‚ë¢ Store only the latest one in *Type* by using `SaveToType` with `Upsert` setting in App.

<img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide11.png" width=70%>  

‚ë† Data to be passed to Procedure.  
```sh
{
‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",
üëâ‚Äúlan‚Äù: 35.6864604,
üëâ‚Äúlon‚Äù: 139.7635769,
‚Äúevent_type‚Äù: "notice_001",
‚Äúimage‚Äù: "data:image/jpe...."
}
```
‚ë° Call your own function which is programmed the logic for comparing positions, from App.    
‚ë¢ Specify the nearest security guard by comparing the location information contained in _the AI camera data which is being stream processing_ and the location information in _the security guard data stored in Type_.    
‚ë£ Store the latest location information of the security guards.  


## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>5. Notify the specified security guard  

<img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide12.png" width=70%>  


‚ë† Transform data to meet the format required for notification. (Transformation)  
‚ë° Source is used not only for receiving but also for sending.    
‚ë¢ E-mail, SMS, Slack, LINE, Teams, etc.

# Introduction to each Resource

|Reource|Description|
|:-----|:---|
|Source|A client that sends and receives data. &nbsp; Sending and Receiving: MQTT, AMQP, Kafka &nbsp; Sending only: HTTP(S), E-mail, SMS|
|Topic|An event bus that passes events between App in Vantiq, etc. It also functions as an endpoint of REST API.|
|Type|Store the data. Resource which corresponds to the DB in Vantiq.|
|App|The application itself which can be developed on GUI by combining prepared patterns and Procedure.|
|Procedure|Resource which can be programmed by oneself. It is possible to use the original features by calling them in App and so on.|

‚ë† Sending data externally and executing other APIs.    
‚ë° Implement the process with combining patterns.    
‚ë¢ Implement the process that is external to the pattern on your own.    
‚ë£ Stream data which is sent from the device.
