# **Lab 06 – Integrating with External Services**

## **Overview**

In this Lab, when a pump failure is detected, make notification of its contents through external services.  
The services that get integrated in this lab are the followings. Feel free to pick any one(s) you want to work with.

-   **[Email](#step-1-email)**

-   **[SMS (Twilio)](#step-2-sms)**

-   **[Teams](#step-3-teams)**

-   **[LINE](#step-4-line)**

-   **[Slack](#step-5-slack)**

***＊ The environment and the account for each service must be prepared in advance.***

 ![Overview](../../imgs/Lab06/image1.png)  

Also, use "**Procedure**" to implement the function to send data. Using Procedure allows to freely program processes that do not exist in the `Activity patterns`. Procedure is a program that can be called from applications created with **App Builder**.

        ***＊ A procedure called "`sendEmail`" will be created.***  
        ***＊ Enter your own Email Address in the "\<Any Email Address\>" field.***  
        ```
        PROCEDURE sendEmail(event)
        // Receiver Email Address
        var toAddress = "<Any Email Address>"
        // Sender Email Address
        var fromAddress = "<Any Email Address>"
        // Contents of Sending
        var subject = "The pump has failed."

## ***▷Checkpoints***

-   Using Source allows to integrate with external services.  
    ✔︎ As for the information on types of sources, please refer to the [External Source Reference Guide](https://dev.vantiq.co.jp/docs/system/sources/source/index.html).  

-   Using `Procedure`, it is possible to implement it according to the format required by the service to be cooperated with.  

-   VANTIQ allows to program in an original language called "**VAIL**", which is a combination of SQL and JavaScript.    
    ✔︎ As for the details, please refer to the [VAIL Reference Guide](https://dev.vantiq.co.jp/docs/system/rules/index.html).
