# Understanding Vantiq Resources through real-world example

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%> Notification system to security guards using AI cameras  

Detect suspicious persons in a large park using AI cameras, and notify the nearest security guard.  

‚û°Ô∏è Compare **location information of AI camera** that detected suspicious person and **location information of all security guards**, and then notify the security guard who is nearest to the suspicious person.  

The sample Apps described in this article are [**here**](../../conf/ai-camera-demo). The followings are the direct links.

# Prerequisites

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>Specification of the AI camera

- Model has been trained to identify the characteristics of suspicious persons.  
- When a suspicious person is captured in the camera view, send the following data via _HTTPS REST_.

```sh
{
‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",    # ID of the AI camera
‚Äúevent_type‚Äù: "notice_001",
‚Äúimage‚Äù: "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAMC...."    # Base64-encoded image
}
```

***‚Äª Generally, AI cameras do not have location information with them.
If they do, AI camera needs to be reconfigured when it gets reinstalled.***


## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>Method of obtaining location information of security guard  

- A security guard has a smartphone with an App that acquires location.    
- App sends the following data to MQTT broker at a certain frequency, such as every 30 seconds.  

```sh
{
"guard_id": "134678493_1",    # ID of each security guard
"type": "location",
"lat": 35.6864604,             # Latitude
"lon": 139.7635769,            # Longitude
"time": 1631083251
}
```

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>Process to be implemented in Vantiq

1. Receive data from AI cameras and the location App.  
   * It should be designed to accomodate future changes (such as data format) flexibly.    

1. Enrich the data sent from AI cameras.  
   * Since AI camera does not have location itself, such data should be maintained in Vantiq side and added when necessary.    

1. Continuously update the latest location of security guards.    
   * In order to minimuze the latency for notification, the location of the security guards should be fetched continuously in Vantiq prior to when a suspicious person is detected.    

1. Compare the location of the AI camera which detected the suspicous person and the locations of security guards.  
   * Identify the nearest security guard on site.    

1. Notify the nearest security guard.    
   * notify via arbitrary channels such as E-mail, SMS, LINE, Slack


# Implementation method

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>1. Ingest data into Vantiq  

<img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide8.png" width=70%>


‚ë†„ÄÄVantiq can process data even if the schema of the data to be received is not defined.    
‚ë°„ÄÄA Source receives data via various protocols.    
‚ë¢„ÄÄA Topic is an endpoint of REST API.    

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>2. Enrich the data sent from AI cameras.

<img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide9.png" width=70%>

‚ë† Sent Data
```sh
{
üëâ‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",
‚Äúevent_type‚Äù: "notice_001",
‚Äúimage‚Äù: "data:image/jpe...."
}
```  
‚ë° Format data as needed, such as changing or deleting parameters. (Transformation)  
‚ë¢ Enrich the stream data that comes from AI cameras. (Enrich)    
```sh
{
üëâ‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",
üëâ‚Äúlan‚Äù: 35.6864604,
üëâ‚Äúlon‚Äù: 139.7635769,
‚Äúevent_type‚Äù: "notice001",
‚Äúimage‚Äù: "data:image/jpe...."
}
```  
‚ë£ Additional information used in ‚ë¢, such as the locations are maintained in Type.
``` sh
{
üëâ‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",
‚Äúlan‚Äù: 35.6864604,
‚Äúlon‚Äù: 139.7635769
}
```

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>3. Continuously update the latest location of security guards.   

<img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide10.png" width=70%>  

‚ë† Sent Data
```sh
{
"guard_id": "134678493_1",

"lat": 35.6864604,
"lon": 139.7635769,
"time": 1631083251
}
```  
‚ë° `Enrich` additional information such as E-mail address, phone number, etc. required for notification.    
‚ë¢ Save to *Type* by `SaveToType` activity with `Upsert` option to retain the latest information only.  

## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>4. Compare the location of the AI camera and the locations of security guards

```sh
{
‚Äúcamera_id‚Äù: "camera_001",
üëâ‚Äúlan‚Äù: 35.6864604,
üëâ‚Äúlon‚Äù: 139.7635769,
‚Äúevent_type‚Äù: "notice_001",
‚Äúimage‚Äù: "data:image/jpe...."
}
```
‚ë° Call the custom procedure to compare locations and identify the nearest security guards   
‚ë¢ Identify the nearest security guard by comparing the location contained in _the AI camera data in the stream_ and the locations in _the security guard data saved in Type_.    
‚ë£ This Type holds the latest locations of the security guards.  


## <img src="../../imgs/Vantiq_resources_introduction/slide1.png" width=1.8%>5. Notify the identified security guard
